# Simple CXX Example of Calling Rust from C++

Hi!
This is a very minimalistic example of calling a Rust struct and associated functions from C++, while doing compilation in C++ as well.
It's a trimmed down version of https://github.com/paandahl/cpp-with-rust/tree/main , please go check their amazing example for more info. 

Mostly using this repo for questions.
